(unsolved)Though this will be one of the last things I would like to see an actual gui that is very user friendly

(unsolved)java downloader
   nonprofit

(unsolved)data validation
   nonprofit
   I'm working to make questions a little nicer and validate the answer every time to ensure that the answer is not mistyped or
      invalid

(unsolved)language update/change
   nonprofit
   I'm either going to update to py3.0 or java but the ultimate goal is to not have it be interperated for ease of use 
      to the end user

(unsolved)error handeling
   nonprofit and anyone else who uses this 
   If you come across an error please notify me(nonprofit) or any one else I need to either fix it or set up an exception
      to make sure that it does not crash but rather alerts the user and is able to give a proper error message befor exiting
      and saving the data to a file to be used as a crash report.
